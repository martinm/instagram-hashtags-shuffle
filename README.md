# readme | instagram-hashtags-shuffle
This shuffle app/webpage allows users to shuffle their set of base hashtags that they are using most of the time. Why shuffle? To avoid infamous Instagram shadow-ban, apparently when you post the same set of hashtags in the same order you look like a bot. 

[LIVE DEMO](https://shuffleme.xyz/)

## how to use?
1. Paste your set of hashtags into the white text box on the top of the page.
2. Click ‘SHUFFLE’ .
3. Click ‘COPY’, the number in brackets represents number of your hashtags.
4. Click ‘CLEAR’.
5. Paste to your document, IG post description etc…
6. Repeat.
